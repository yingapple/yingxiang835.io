<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an explorer in the field of AI and Big Data, beginning my academic journey in 2010 at Tsinghua University where I obtained my undergraduate degree, and graduated with a Master's degree in 2017.</p>
<p>Post-graduation, I joined the 2B AI and Big Data team at Huawei as a Tech Leader and Senior Engineer. The team I led, which included colleagues from Moscow, successfully completed several provincial AI projects.</p>
<p>In 2020, I joined Alibaba Cloud as an Algorithm Expert. There, I spearheaded the development of the Neuro-symbolic AI architecture, overseeing cutting-edge technological exploration, implementation of cloud services, showcasing PoCs externally, and promoting internal collaboration projects.</p>
<p>From 2022 onward, I serve as the Co-founder and AI VP at Mindverse. At Mindverse, I guide the team in the development of an independent UMM framework. This is a truly actionable Autonomous Agent framework, on which we've launched our MindOS product. Throughout my career, I have dedicated myself to enhancing team performance and driving technical innovation. I look forward to continuing to contribute to this challenging and opportunity-rich field in the future. I am a deep, pioneering AI practitioner who is always pushing the boundaries of the industry.</p>
